    "Create a class called `Client`. When a client object is instantiated, it should set two data attributes: `username` and `password`. Give this class a unique representation which only shows the username, but obfuscates the password by changing the actual password to all X's that have the same length as the original password. For instance when someone prints a client object, it should show something like:\n",

    "`<Client username:benneely password:XXXXXX\\>`\n",

    "Create a class `GitHubCaller`. This class should inherit from the Client class. GitHubCaller should have a data attribute named `base_url`. During instantiation, set this value to `https://api.github.com`. It should also have a property attribute called `endpoint`. During instantiation, set this value to `/orgs/bios821-2018`. Create a method for this class called `getit`. This method should `return` a python dictionary that is the result of an authenticated `GET` request to the endpoint. All other functionality (e.g. representation) should be handled by the `Client` class. "

    "At the end of the `numpy` notebook from class, I've added a section that shows how one could simulate a nonlinear relationship between two arrays. Using this example, create two new arrays whose dependency is parabolic. The vertex of the parabola should be at x=2. If any of the x values are negative discard them. Don't forget to also discard the corresponding y elements. Use an `assert` statement to ensure the arrays have the same shape."
